To move a monkey, there are 2 options: 
+ Move a colored monkey to the number that is displayed on the same color Monkey card.
+ Move a colored monkey to the number that is resulted from addition or subtraction of 2 Monkey cards that have the same color.

To move the elephant, the monkey has to be moved first. There are 2 Elephant cards that have numbers on it and the players can choose one number on one of the card to move or they can skip the Elephant move if it is too risky.
